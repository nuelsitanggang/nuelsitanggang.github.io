Hi!<br/>
This is a personal blog for my personal writings, mostly collection of my Twitter thread and notes. I have used several blogging website but somehow I don't have a sense of ownership over my writings.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that Github pages usually used as a professional portfolio pages. I may use that in the future, but for now I am enjoying learing how to configure my blog manually. It's tedious but it feels like tending a garden, so the satisfaction is coming from the struggle when trying to understand how Github works and how this template works. <br/>
<br/>
If you're a friend of mine from Twitter, welcome. Basically my talking point is more or less the same with my tweets but it will be more elaborated.<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
