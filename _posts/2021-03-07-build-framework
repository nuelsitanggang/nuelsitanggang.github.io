You should build your own framework of thinking. You don't have to reinvent the wheel, but you have to actively build one. You're already conditioned by school and family and friends. We have the fundamentals but we often don't really aware what how we think. We should recognize our own biases and optimize it. Trim the unnecessary, adopt what is useful from the environment. You gotta work for it. After that, you can start focusing on one of the most important thing: To trust your own judgement.
