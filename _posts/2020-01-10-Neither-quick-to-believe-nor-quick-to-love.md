The art of worldly wisdom #154

/Translated by Christoper Maurer/<br/>
Neither quick to believe, nor quick to love. A ripe judgment is slow to believe. Lying is ordinary; let belief be extraordinary. The rush to judgment leads to embarrassment and exhaustion. But don’t cast doubt openly on the truthfulness of others. When you treat someone like a liar, or insist he has been deceived, you add insult to injury. There is an even greater disadvantage: not believing others implies that you yourself are deceitful. The liar suffers twice: he neither believes nor is believed. Prudent listeners suspend their judgment. Nor, an author tells us,* should we be quick to love. One lies with words, but also with things, and the latter sort of deceit results in more harm.<br/>

/Translated by Jeremy Robbins (Penguin Books)/<br/>
Don’t be too quick to believe or to bestow affection.Maturity is revealed by a slowness to believe; lies are commonplace, so let belief be rare. Whoever is easily swayed is soon embarrassed by it. But don’t voice your doubts about a person’s truthfulness, this just adds insult to injury, because it treats them as either a deceiver or as someone deceived. And this isn’t the worst of it, since an unwillingness to believe others is a sign of being a liar, for a liar has a double misfortune, neither believing nor being believed. Sensible listeners suspend their judgement and should trust the author who says eagerness to bestow affection is a form of imprudence*. For you can lie not only with words, but with actions, and this second form of deceit is more pernicious because of its consequences.<br/>

*eagerness to bestow affection is a form of imprudence: Cicero, On Friendship, XVII.63, XXII.85
