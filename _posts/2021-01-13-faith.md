For my friends, for my family. For those who still have faith in me, I will not let you down.<br/>
Life has been tough lately, but thank you for staying around during hard times.<br/>
I am sorry for my flaws and shortcoming. If you notice me doing something wrong please point it out and I'll work on it immediately. 
I will do the best of my ability to amend my mistakes<br/>
<br/>
I will bounce back, I will find my light and I will thrive.<br/>
I'm building my discipline and and I'm starting to feel inside me the raging fire of the will to live.<br/>
It is a long journey and I have a lot to catch up, but I'm up to the task.<br/>
Stick with me as I will stick with you.<br/>
We will celebrate our achievements, big or smal. We will cherish our strength and deal with our shortcomings.<br/>
The tunnel will end and the God's light will shine upon us once again.<br/>
We will have a big feast, toast a drink and talk all night long reminiscing our trials and tribulation.<br/>
<br/>
But for now have faith in me as I have faith in you.<br/>
Cultivate trust and be dependable to each other.<br/>
We will make it. We will make it together. I know it.<br/>
