Last year was really tough for me. A lot of guilt, regret, anger and dissapointment that leads to multiple breakdowns. At one point I lost my purpose in life. It was a really lonely experience. Though my friends are around to accompany me, I know I have to overcome this alone.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I learned while I'm trying to get my shit together in the valley of despair is I was become more receptive to nature and art. I have a newfound sense of appreciation to songs, paintings, poem, heck even skies and clouds and dance and movies. Maybe it's temporary but any emotional feelings are now 5 times more intense than normal condition. Love songs sounds more bucin, break-up songs are now painful, dancing feels more liberating. I discover broader range of emotions. I will talk about that later.

"Mary Ellen Carter" is a song recommended by a [Twitter friend](https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/1342349539068452865?s=20) to me. It helped him through his divorce and he think it will helps me too. It does, singing this song feels like a therapy. Uplifting and reassuring, it helped me to rebuild my conviction and overcoming betrayal and humiliation. To rise again like the Mary Ellen Carter lifted from the bottom of the sea. I was drowned but now I'm prepared to salvage my ship.

This is my favorite part

>And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow<br/>
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go<br/>
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain<br/>
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again<br/><br/>
>**Rise again, rise again; though your heart it be broken<br/>
And life about to end<br/>
No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend<br/>
Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again**<br/>
