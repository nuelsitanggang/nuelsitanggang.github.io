My relationship ended last year, but I still struggling every single day until this day.<br/>
The sadness has started to subside, but it left me with anger, hate, and humiliation.<br/>
There are bad days, my moment of weakness.<br/>
I'm exhausted. truly exhausted.<br/>

<br/>
It's never enough, I'm never enough. I gave all what I got. I shared all what's mine. I loved her with all of my heart, but it's never enough. I gave her all of my trust. I thought I could trust her. I guess I was wrong.<br/>

Sometimes I still get sad, but then I remember. My loss was her gain. My grief was her sigh of relief. If she don't have the faith in me as much my faith in her, then she is free to go.<br/>

I can't help but thinking about this every single day. There are times that my heart gets tender, then I remind myself that is useless and pointless. She's not going back and she's not thinking about me either. When I was grieving, she already found a new boyfriend in less than two weeks. She changes her heart so quick as if nothing happened before. One day she told me I was the love of her life and then suddenly I was an old acquintance from school.<br/>
