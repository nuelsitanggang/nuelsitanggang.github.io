My relationship ended last year, but I still struggling every single day until this day.<br/>
The sadness has started to subside, but it left me with anger, hate, and humiliation.<br/>
There are bad days, my moment of weakness.<br/>
I'm exhausted. truly exhausted.<br/>

Sometimes I still get sad, but then I remember that she doesn't want me anymore. She won't come back and she's not thinking of me either. My grief of loss is her sigh of relief. When I was alone grieving, she's already got a new one in less than two weeks. Two freaking weeks. Meanwhile, I don't know what it takes for me to overcome this, since this is not the first time she left me. Why oh why did I put my trust in her.<br/>

It's never enough, I'm never enough. I gave all that I got. I shared everything I had. I loved her with all of my heart, but it's never enough. I gave her all of my trust 100%. I thought I could trust her. I guess I was wrong.<br/>

My loss was her gain. My grief was her sigh of relief. If she doesn't have the faith in me as much as my faith in her, she is free to go. Maybe it's for the best. If she's going to leave anyway, the sooner the better. She'll leave me, if not today, tomorrow, or next year. <br/>

I can't help but thinking about this every single day. There are times that my heart gets tender, then I remind myself that is useless and pointless. She's not going back and she's not thinking about me either. When I was grieving, she already found a new boyfriend in less than two weeks. She changes her heart so quick as if nothing happened before. One day she told me I was the love of her life and then suddenly I'm just an old acquaintance from school.<br/>

It's my fault anyway. It's my fault that I fell in love. It's my fault that I deluded myself into thinking that I'm special. Never was, never will. It's my fault that I trust her. I should not have listened to her. It was all a lie. It was all a big lie. I was only served as a rebound.<br/>

I'm not a saint, I know I have flaws. I know I have my own problems to face and demons to fight with. I took responsibility of my suffering. What happened to me was caused of either ignorance, lack of knowledge, or lack of courage. It's my fault and I will learn. When the time comes, I will do 10x better.<br/>

I wish her the best, I hope she's happy and found what she's looking for. However, I have no intention to forgive her. I won't forgive her for treating me like a disposable. One day she said she loved me until one day she told me she didn't feel anything anymore. She violated every promise that we set together. I should have seen this coming, when the spark has dimmed she will look for someone new.<br/> 

I wish I could forget everything and sincerely wish that we will never have to cross paths again. I don't want to remember anything from her except the pain she caused. I don't want to talk about her, I don't want to try to know any information about her, I don't want any of my friends to speak of her name in my presence. I will forget but I won't forgive.<br/>

The wound is not healed, I'm in constant pain. The pain is still there, it's the tolerance that getting stronger. I'm grieving for losing the person I loved, the future that I was trying to build, but I don't mourn for the betrayal. I shall not mourn the betrayal. If anything, it's the pain of being betrayed that makes me strong.<br/>

If you're my friend reading this, maybe you'll say to me like come on, it's been months. Maybe you're right. Life goes on right? She's already moved to another phase of her life anyway, why should I stuck? Yeah, I will overcome, but not today. Today, let me clenched my fist, clutching to the ember of hatred and anger. I know I'll hurt myself, but I have prepared for that.<br/>

I don't know if you can learn anything from my story, but I just want to remind you that **the chance of your loved ones turn their back and betray you is low but never zero**.
