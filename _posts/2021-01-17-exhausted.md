My relationship ended last year, but I still struggling every single day until this day.<br/>
The sadness has started to subside, but it left me with anger, hate, and humiliation.<br/>
There are bad days, my moment of weakness.<br/>
I'm exhausted. truly exhausted.<br/>

It's never enough, I'm never enough. I gave all what I got. I shared all what's mine. I loved her with all of my heart, but it's never enough. I gave her all of my trust. I thought I could trust her. I guess I was wrong.<br/>

Sometimes I still get sad, but then I remember. My loss was her gain. My grief was her sigh of relief. If she don't have the faith in me as much my faith in her, she is free to go.<br/>

I can't help but thinking about this every single day. There are times that my heart gets tender, then I remind myself that is useless and pointless. She's not going back and she's not thinking about me either. When I was grieving, she already found a new boyfriend in less than two weeks. She changes her heart so quick as if nothing happened before. One day she told me I was the love of her life and then suddenly I was an old acquintance from school.<br/>

It's my fault anyway. It's my fault that I fell in love. It's my fault that I delude myself thinking that I'm special. Never was, never will. It's my fault that I trust her. I should have listened to her. It was all a lie. It was all a big lie. I was only a rebound.<br/>

I wish I could forget everything and I sincerely wish that I will never have to cross path again. I have no intention to forgive her. I will remember her last words, "I need to go, any closing statement?". My blood boils everytime I remember that.<br/>

The wound is not healed, I'm in constant pain. The pain is still there, it's the tolerance that getting better.<br/>

If you're my friend and you think this is silly and I should move on. Maybe you're right. Life's go on right? She's already move to another phase of her life anyway. I will, but not today. I just want to remind you that **the chances of your loved ones turn their back and betray you is low but never zero**.
