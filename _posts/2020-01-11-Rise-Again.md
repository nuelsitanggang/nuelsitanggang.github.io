[![Rise Again](http://img.youtube.com/vi/Fhop5VuLDIQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhop5VuLDIQ)

>And you, to whom adversity has dealt the final blow<br/>
With smiling bastards lying to you everywhere you go<br/>
Turn to, and put out all your strength of arm and heart and brain<br/>
And like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again<br/><br/>
>Rise again, rise again; though your heart it be broken<br/>
And life about to end<br/>
No matter what you've lost, be it a home, a love, a friend<br/>
Like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again<br/>
